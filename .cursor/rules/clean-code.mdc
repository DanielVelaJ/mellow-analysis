Please stick to best modern practices. 
- Use src layout. 
- Clearly document functions and modules according to best modern practices. 
- Add extensive comments to make code readable. 
- Name files, modules, functions, etc. with meaningful names according to best modern practices. 
- Use poetry for dependency management and installation of packages. 
- Make sure the README.md is allways up to date. 
- Always prefer absolute imports over relative imports.
- Centralize configuration when possible according to best modern practices.
- Always think of how your changes may impact the repo structure and choose the best repo structure so that the codebase follows best modern practices. 
- Centralize logging configuration whenever possible and make sure to use logging properly so that logs are informative and say where they come from. 
- Make sure that the pyproject.toml is up to date and uses the modern syntax. Do not edit it directly to add dependencies, instead do it through poetry commands. 

We want to write mantainable, scalable clean code that always follows best modern practices. 
- Use modern best naming conventions when necessary.
