## Benefits of the New Report

1. **Executive-Friendly**: Clear summaries and visual indicators make it easy for leadership to understand key insights quickly

2. **Data Transparency**: Every metric shows how it's calculated, making the report more trustworthy and educational

3. **Actionable Insights**: Each section includes specific recommendations based on the data

## How to Generate the Improved Report

```bash
# From the project root directory
python -m src.mellow_analysis.reports.generate_improved_report
```

This will create `mellow_analytics_report_improved.pdf` with all the enhancements.

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Add Comparative Analysis**: Include month-over-month or cohort comparisons
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Add forecasting for key metrics
3. **Custom Branding**: Further customize colors and styling to match Mellow brand
